anova_bf(
  dataset,
  design,
  rscaleFixed = "medium",
  rscaleRandom = "nuisance",
  rscaleCont = "medium",

}
\arguments{
\item{dataset}{A data frame in (long) ANOVA format:
the \strong{first} column is the subject identifier,
the \strong{last} column is the dependent variable,
and the columns in between are factors (between/within are inferred from \code{design}).}

\item{design}{A single string specifying the design. It must contain
exactly one \code{"s"} (for subjects). Letters left of \code{"s"} are
between-subject factors; letters right of \code{"s"} are within-subject factors.
Examples: \code{"sAB"} (two within), \code{"ABsC"} (two between, one within).}

\item{rscaleFixed}{Prior scale for fixed effects. Default \code{"medium"}.}

\item{rscaleRandom}{Prior scale for random effects. Default \code{"nuisance"}.}

\item{rscaleCont}{Prior scale for continuous covariates. Default \code{"medium"}.}

\item{rscaleEffects}{Optional vector of prior scales for individual effects.}

\item{method}{Method for computing Bayes factors; see \code{BayesFactor::generalTestBF()}.
Default \code{"auto"}.}

\item{progress}{Logical; show progress bar? Default \code{TRUE}.}

\item{multicore}{Logical; use multicore processing? Default \code{FALSE}.}

\item{summarize}{Logical; if \code{TRUE} (default), return a summarized tibble;
if \code{FALSE}, return the raw \code{BayesFactor} result.}

\item{inc_ranef}{Logical; when summarizing, also include random-effect terms
in the table (passed to \code{mutolabr::summary_generalTestBF()}).}

\item{seed}{Optional numeric seed to reproduce Monte Carlo results; passed to
\code{withr::with_seed()}.}
}
\value{
If \code{summarize = TRUE} (default), a tibble summarizing Bayes factors
for exclusion of each term from the full model, with columns:
\describe{
\item{effect}{Effect removed from the full model (fixed or, optionally, random).}
\item{BF}{Bayes factor for the null (exclusion) vs. alternative (full).}
\item{error}{Estimated numerical error.}
\item{log10_BF}{Base-10 logarithm of BF.}
\item{favor}{Whether data favor the null or alternative.}
\item{evidence}{Evidence category (e.g., "anecdotal", "moderate", ...).}
}
If \code{summarize = FALSE}, returns the \code{BayesFactor} object produced by
\code{generalTestBF()}.
}
\description{
Bayesian ANOVA Wrapper Using \code{BayesFactor::generalTestBF}
}
\details{
Runs a Bayesian ANOVA for between-participants, within-participants, or mixed designs via
\code{BayesFactor::generalTestBF(..., whichModels = "top")}, given a compact
design string (e.g., \code{"sABC"}, \code{"ABsC"}). One subject column, one
dependent variable column, and factor columns in between are assumed.

Internally the function:
\itemize{
\item Validates \code{design} (\code{"s"} must appear exactly once) and checks that
the number of factor columns matches the count implied by \code{design}.
\item Renames columns to \code{"s"} (subject), \code{"fb1","fb2",...} (between),
\code{"fw1","fw2",...} (within), and \code{"y"} (outcome), then coerces factors.
\item Drops rows with missing values and unused factor levels.
\item Builds the fixed-effect formula including all main effects and all interactions
among \code{fb*} and \code{fw*}.
\item Sets random effects to \code{s} and \code{s:fw} combinations for all within-factor
subsets \strong{except} the highest-order within interaction (which coincides with the residual
error term in classical ANOVA). No between-factor terms are included as random effects.
\item Standardizes \code{y} to mean 0 and SD 1 prior to analysis.
}
The Bayes factors are computed with \code{whichModels = "top"} (full model vs.
models with one term removed) and summarized via \code{mutolabr::summary_generalTestBF()}.

\examples{
# Example 1: between-participants design (design = "ABs")

anova_bf(data_fict_between, design = "ABs", seed = 610, progress = FALSE)

# Example 2: within-participants design (design = "sAB")

anova_bf(data_fict_within, design = "sAB", seed = 610, progress = FALSE)

# Example 3: mixed design (between = A, within = C)

anova_bf(data_fict_mixed, design = "AsB", seed = 610, progress = FALSE)
